# Changelog

## Unreleased

- IMAP SEARCH: `CHARSET` (UTF-8 and US-ASCII; others get `NO [BADCHARSET]`), literal search strings, bare
  sequence sets, `UID` with sequence-set lists, and the CONDSTORE `MODSEQ` criterion with `(MODSEQ n)` in the
  SEARCH and SORT responses.
- IMAP SEARCH: header criteria match RFC 2047 encoded words decoded, so UTF-8 searches find encoded subjects
  and names.
- IMAP SORT/THREAD: accept the charset argument RFC 5256 requires; a search program with parentheses after the
  sort keys no longer fails with `BAD`.
- IMAP THREAD: thread lists in the response follow each other with no space (`(1 2)(5)`), as RFC 5256 requires.

## 0.3.0

- License: GNU AGPL v3.0 only (`AGPL-3.0-only`), copyright BLUEBOX SOFTWARE S.L. Contributions under the
  [CLA](CLA.md). Third-party notices in [NOTICE](NOTICE).
- Antispam plugin rewritten on the rspamd rules: rspamd symbol names, default scores and actions (greylist 4,
  add header 6, reject 15). **The config format changed:** rewrite `<data_dir>/antispam/config.json` from
  `examples/antispam/config.json.example` before upgrading; see [docs/antispam-ops.md](docs/antispam-ops.md).
  The list files keep their names.
- Security policy: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## 0.2.0

- Debian package (`make deb`): installs `beaver` and the antispam plugin, a systemd unit and a loopback-only
  config on first install; the data directory is readable by its owner only.
- An API key closes `/setup`, for installs managed only by a provisioner.
- IMAP: full LIST-EXTENDED (RFC 5258) with the RFC 6154 special-use options.
- IMAP: `LIST "" ""` returns the hierarchy delimiter, and the reference is joined to the pattern.
- IMAP: `CREATE` makes the missing parent mailboxes; `LSUB` with `%` shows unsubscribed parents.

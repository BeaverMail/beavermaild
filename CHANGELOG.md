# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Debian package (`make deb`): installs `beaver` and the antispam plugin, a systemd unit and a loopback-only
  config on first install; the data directory is readable by its owner only.
- An API key closes `/setup`, for installs managed only by a provisioner.
- IMAP: full LIST-EXTENDED (RFC 5258) with the RFC 6154 special-use options.
- IMAP: `LIST "" ""` returns the hierarchy delimiter, and the reference is joined to the pattern.
- IMAP: `CREATE` makes the missing parent mailboxes; `LSUB` with `%` shows unsubscribed parents.
